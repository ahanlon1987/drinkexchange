DrinkExchange
 
Combining two of my favorite things, software, and drinking
DrinkExchange would let bar owners tap into the modern trend of gamification combined with the age-old activity of drinking to turn their bar into a real time, responsive drink market using simple economic principles. 
For example, if a person orders, say, 5 whiskey & cokes, the price of  whiskey & cokes will rise, due to the increase in demand. 
If nobody is ordering, gin & tonics, the price will to drop. 
If a bar order wants to have a happy hour, the market could "crash" causing all prices to lower
Bar owners would have the ability to set opening prices and will be given tools to monitor price elasticity of demand (how much price changes affect demand) 
Risky owners could have bigger price fluctuations per unit of demand. 
Certain rules, such as price floors/ceilings would be in place to prevent extreme prices
What we would be building
A hosted application that integrates with existing Point-of-sale APIs to track drink orders, and update their prices. 
The webapp would also have an interface that would be shown at the bar, mimicking a stock ticker, showing drinks and their current prices.
The app would automatically consume drink orders, and process them through the pricing engine, that would return a price amount. 
The demand for jack could affect jim
Our revenue would be either subscription based and/or a margin of the sales. 
Could take a percentage of sales that are above average prices. 
E.g., bud lights are normally $4.00, with our app running, they sold 100 at an average of $4.75, we take 50% of that, so we make $37.5
Selling points
Gamifying drinking, gets people buying things they normally wouldn't buy, because of the bargain, or thrill of the market
Don't have to buy into market-themed bar, just one, maybe two nights a week
Potential Increase in foot traffic 
Read only mode for sales pitches, give bar owners the side by side view of what they did in revenue, versus what they could have done in revenue with our app
Mobile integration - allow people to see what "whiskey" is trading at over at their favorite watering hole
Potential to partner with alcohol distributors. E.g., your brand's price will remain unchanged by any demand, or we'll show it more on the ticker, etc., etc., 
Potential to link across bars, all Bar-1 taverns are linked, so ordres at Duffy's affect prices at McGee's, etc. etc., 
Cons
Risk is with POS systems, how many are there, how exposed are the API
